        On moralizing<br><br><br>


There are many instances where innocuous aspects of life are moralized, heavily. one such example is the idea that it is bad to claim that some are more fit for certain jobs, whereas others are not. two points can be made here. the first is that these claims aren't making metaphysical, theoretical or essentialist arguments about the nature of personalities. they are mere practical inferences. they say: "given the finite time we have, and the mental resources we've got after the age of 25, it is highly unlikely that we will manage to totally rewire ourselves such that we can turn our sentimental character into a brutally logical type, because unearthing the primordial bricks laid in our formative years is an endeavor that would itself take the rest of human life to achieve". this is the type of practical i mean. and secondly, those claims are merely paying mind to the ways different experiences incline people's personalities in different ways. war makes risk averse people, and a life of utter solitude makes someone naive. the former could become a fantastic security operations officer, whereas the latter would be better suited for introverted work (writing, baking, etc). this is all fine. none of these professions imply that either person is incompetent. we cannot be rich in all aspects of life, and chasing proficiency is a coping mechanism that stems from the rejection felt in being inferior in that specific skill/domain. usually sentimental kids will try hard to sculpt their minds to be more logical, if their parent thought their emotions were burdensome. that's just the way it is.

<br><br>embracing the things you are good at and leaning into them is fantastic - it lets you nourish a relationship with who you truly are, who you've always been, and the thing that you even feel yourself to be amazing at. but moralizing your deficits is not the way.
<br><br>it is okay to say that some people should really reconsider their career choices. it is not a matter of them not being able to achieve that particular thing, but that it would be a waste to take up the path that wasn't theirs to begin with. you will likely find the journey boring. 

<br><br>and doing anything for the purpose of proving to yourself that you can, is a wasted attempt. it is futile. because the proof will fall flat: you knew you'd always be able to, but what you actually thought is that you would derive fulfilment and regenerating happiness from that achievement, will not happen, unless you did it for yourself only. which you did not - you did it out of insecurity and fear. that is a bad potion. throw it out!
