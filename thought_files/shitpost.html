        deploying a schrodingerian skepticism to politics is a prerequisite of any healthy critiquing mind.

I'm going to try to argue, everso roughly, why i think that we need to be fundamentally skeptical. these thoughts came to me while i was reading, on the shitter, about an anthropological examination on the idiom of depression, as viewed from western and non western medicines (or more, eastern and non-eastern medicines), where i realized that much of the medicinal knowledge we accept in the modern world is according to a standardized source, which we unanimously do not question. the dsm5 holds the diagnosis information and criteria of depression. we accept that as just what "is". but we have no clue as to whether the grounds for that criteria is based in highly culturally contextual and therefore contingent markers.

what i mean is, depression is characterized and regarded differently in each society. it cannot be regarded as a static concept, independent of all these varied details. therefore it should be much more fluid as it is now.

in the anthropological paper i was reading, depression can be defined top-down, ie from professionals to patients, or down-up, from the people first. there were many examples of different diagnosis tendencies, such as that American doctors are more likely to diagnose a depression symptom showing patient with schitophernia, whereas in uk they are more likely to diagnose manic-depression. in the uk they recognize the manifold ways that this condition can express itself. similarly, women will quickly be diagnosed with 'postpartum depression', when the very criteria for a healthy recovery after pregnancy is: a community, lots of sleep, help from the partner. Why not just start diagnose me with 
soft-nimble-ass disorder when i sit on a seat of broken glass? right. 

there are also many societies in which the depression diagnosis is irrelevant, redundant, misleading. in a post-war soviet landscape brutalist shithole, pushing the 'ailment' onto the people might be offensive. they say: its me who's sick? what would you be, if your pension was nonexistent, you can't afford to take the bus to the main city square, and you worked not for your future, but for the debts of your past? seriously people, lets pack up this north American optimism-masquerading-the-corruption spiel and admit that diagnosing people as sick does not 'open up discussions' for 'future change'. what and where in the fuck this idea even came from is beyond me. has that honestly worked well for us, even here? are we really talking? or talking about talking? and then graduate students who drink 8$USD green smoothies will write their thesis about what "we" [THE AMERICAN TWATS] should approach and broach the problems of the middle east. hey sally, why dont you take your lululemon behind and come to Qatar? before you even get to open your mouth about xyz issue, it'll be clasped shut. to reserve my crudity from spoiling this speech, i will not detail how that might happen to you in the man-reigned middle east. 

no clue as to why i got upset there but my side thought is that writing should be seamlessly poured out of the mind. of course, embed the research where it should go. but it's corrupt and might i say RETARDED to polish and filter and veil the world from how you really feel about what you're saying. people believe anything that sounds confident. we all know that. and we do it to eachother. anyways. let me return to my initial point.

a schrodingerian skepticism, follows the thought experiment that loosely explains that a cat in a box is both dead and alive prior to investigation. i dont know, nor do i care whether this quantum physics hypothetical can be used in the way im using it, but im using it.

so the gist is that we do not know the internal politics behind a largely/widely claimed truth. when the dsm5 is published, when certain files are released implicating major figures of our modern world, we must caution and refrain ourselves from accepting it as an absolute static truth of the world. because if you use the dsm5 as the starting point of reasoning, then of course it would make sense that some people just 'are' sick and need the help that the manual insists: 500mg of sertraline taken twice orally with food. it doesn't allow you to imagine the sickness in your living conditions, in your waking world, in the dynamics that rush around you in a cyclonic flurry, inevitably shaping your capacity for optimism or of hopeful imagination. i have, elsewhere in my writing, spoken at lengths about the benefits of narrativization. the reason why i bring it up here & now is because it is integral, in my opinion, to use the work of fiction to narrate a future for yourself where you are able to truly imagine the life you want without restraint. yes that sounds hippie enough, but the psychological motivation for this treatment method is that people often live in between very sad and dullened beliefs constellations. in reaching for their 'past' life, or into the world of fiction, they may be able to write aboutYEARN  themselves as the true main character of their story, one where they got everything they dreamed of from the get-go, before their major traumas happened. i am not talking about their adult wishes of having an assault rifle on Christmas, but the dream where they were the hero of their middle school, saved their first love from being mauled by wolves. 

again, again back to my point.... the starting point cannot just be some external 'academic' source that we must accept because we live in the geographical proximity to the author's university. it needs to be situated, and even situated within each individual person. i am not trying to sound anti-scientific here, i do love research and the work it does, but we are not really taught the ways in which politics has shaped our science. the standard for science is different everywhere. same with philosophy. after the cold war, continental philosophy was seen as the concrete path to communism. and thus it was unofficially banished from the university programmes. now we live in a world where philosophy involves more math than it does the socratic method. and also, the ways in which our essays were evaluated were always analaytical. i can not even count on one hand (for this occasion has never arisen) the times where i was allowed to construe my own theory, without having to prove its credibility within the confines of the system we were discussing. i was only intelligibly able to posit my own theories about narcissism insofar as i was using Freudian lingo, and working with his idea that the ego the id and the superego were in a polygamous maritial conflict where neither wants to cooperate. god forbid i say anything that doesn't take that as my starting point - instant zero, immediately reported to the dean, and a swift expulsion by the university for the charges of thinking without approval. ridiculous!


again, my greatest weakness in writing pronounces itself despite my avails to keep it hidden: i did not fully elaborate my initial point which was the entire point of the last n-paragraphs.

right, so lets try to approach everything with a foucaultian lens. let us first imagine the conditions under which these studies, examinations, thesis were written. my desire beyond all else is for people to truly grasp the initutive blindess of statistics. a number, or study, will merely tell you about the average or correlation of that group. that is not as interesting in my opinion as the possible reasons why that study yeiled a desired result whence the true cause was something else. are you picking up what im putting down? in a very basic example: let us suppose that today i am very sad because i have not listened to the blade runner soundtrack. i do a study that asks what my feelings are today, and why. i state that im sad i didn't listen to music. the research headline roars the next day: people are sad when they are not stimulated in the way they like! 
well, in fact, the issue isn't that as much as its that i have some weird deep fascination for blade runner that would be much more interesting in a study about schizoids, or INFPS, or about the sci-fi genre. i was just in the wrong study. and thus i contributed my result to that study when im actually someone who doesn't get sad in any other occasion when i dont get what i want. 

see what i mean? poor example but the point there should mean something.
