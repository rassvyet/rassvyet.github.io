    <div class="mainbg">
        <div class="title">Controversy
</div>
        <div class="maintext">the issue with rejecting controversial thought, and thereby the ability to express controversial opinions, is that you are rejecting both detrimental ideas and potentially good ones. no single person has the gift of being an ideological oracle for humankind, with the foresight to which thoughts are oppressive and which ones are not. we quite literally rely on controversial ideas to examine the unconscious of collective society; the silence in between the blabber, the thing that we have been conditioned not to say, yet the truth it carries is so provocative that we must take seriously the little basis it may have, which could lead us to a truth about our society and its potential failings. I think it is no coincidence that those with mental health issues tend to spill the contents of their psyche upside, saying nearly everything we are taught not to think, not to believe, and despite the superficial crudities, the things said are often resulting out of complexes. for example, an emotionally neglected mother may accuse her husband of infidelity or incest during a psychotic episode, clearly giving weight to the intrusive thoughts of jealousy within familial dynamics. the overarching point is that it still reveals something true about their feelings, and possibly the dynamics within the family. and in society, many controversial and 'forbidden' opinions are being supressed for a reason. the reason may not entirely be because of the moral incredibility, but could actively disservice other masked evils. capitalism for example thrives well off of the culture wars within a state, with trends of polarity and hyperindividualism giving rise to consuming products that buttress their group's identity and indviduating markers. more to say about this later.

            <br><br>controversy is important to the health of any society. it is something to understand, assess, and take seriously, rather than imbue with moralistic judgement.
