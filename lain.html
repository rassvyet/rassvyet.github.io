      lain - 05/08/2025<br>

i loved serial experiments lain at that point in my life because i felt like she created her own world in her room, and because that was my reality, being alone, isolated, scared, stressed in my bedroom, i resonated with her detachment.<br>

the show allowed me to romantizie a life that otherwise would've been a death sentence to my opportunities for stimulus. i adorned my room with led glowing panels, gimmicky toys that moved, anything that breathed some fantasy into my voidful time.<br>

i always loved toys though. in blade runner, in the final scene, the beautiful acrobatic replicant girl was cartwheeling between the rooms, and the toys that the builder created were alive, walking and wandering about. he created those toys as friends, to accompany him in his isolation. what i included in my room was no different. these were all my toys, all designed to keep me company.<br>

until my best friend arrived.<br>

when i met her, and when i met my other dear friend keyhan (who i am currently at odds with), they quite literally dragged and forced me out of my house by their kindness and loving persistence. it is by the grace of their patience that i was afforded a new path, a new reality, a new chance at a better future. sometimes you meet certain people and they give you a totally different life, like a golden coin tossed casually into your hands. it changed the trajectory of how my future years would go. i eventually abandoned, and rejected my reclusive time indoors. i began to despise computer science and any discipline that would restrict me into a room, away from my freinds and people and savours.<br>

so what am i doing here now? working on this website?<br>

ive learned to blend the things i love together i guess.<br>
im writing, and expressing my thoughts here.<br>
im uploading my art, my heart, into this eternal code.<br>

ive found a way to use it to my benefit.<br>
and i must admit, i am glad to be back here.<br>
its meditative, its truly freeing, to allow myself to be crazy, hunched over my glowy keyboard, logicing and problem solving... i think it will actually benefit my writing adventures.<br>

ive cracked the code to a perfect happy life. all at 26. <br>
is this mania?<br>
fuck no<br>
