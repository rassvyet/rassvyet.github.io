    <h1>Wraith</h1>
    <p>
      sometime in 2023<br>

<p>My welting weary heart,
<br />left bloodless, wan, and pale,
<br />was pacing lifelessly,
<br />before an aimless looming trail.
<br /><br />This stray wraith,
<br />although fateless and obtrusively inchoate,
<br />never found herself moved by lures of gaity,
<br />or tales of galliant resplenent strength.<br />
<br />Until one day,<br />a relic was found,
<br />burrowed deep under her path,<br />
this ravishing treasure had stayed,<br />
embossed with dirt and sand,<br />waiting to be saved
<br /><br />before the wraith glanced down,
<br />her ravenous senses were awoke,
<br />needing not light or sound,<br />
to realize her voracious heart was pulsing with stroke&nbsp;<br />
<br />and so this treasure and wraith rejoiced,<br />
not knowing the destitution they endured,<br />
for living without the other was a curse,<br />
but remaining together was a love so pure.</p>
