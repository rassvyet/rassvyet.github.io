        <div class="title">The Tail of Quid Ruckinus
</div>
        <div class="maintext">

            
<br>
<br>"God strike me down", Quid Ruckinus bemoaned.
<br>Lamenting on the days before his mingling with slime begun, our nauseating character anointed his jowls with the thick trimmings of horse fat, this ridiculous remedy being brought on by the trickings of a false tale told by his jester-friend, Qort Tuft. Sludging his fingers against his boney face, Quid Ruckinus caught a whiff of the aged blubber which enticed this peculiar character's appetite to a uncommentable degree. suddenly, struck with animalistic hunger, he slid/drew his finger from the edges of his jaw right into his mouth, landing thrustfully on his soaking tongue. a frenzy took over our odd character, no: a mental madness more like, and for the first time (surprisingly) in his life he sat in his chamber gnawing at his finger as though the nerves of that little limb were already severed from the rest of his feeling body. there is no apt theory to explain why he nearly devoured his finger to the bone. he was not starved- unusually thin, yes, but he made his presence at every square meal-time. though dinner consisted mainly of his popping the peas on his plate or puncturing other foods, he did consume the remains after making them into an encompassing sludge. but still, nevertheless, our character is sat in his room eating his finger to his heart's delight. right before he was to make a grieving blow to the middle of his finger nail, his chamber door swung open, followed swiftly by his head which spun so quick that it nearly swung off his own neck. the intruder locked eyes with her son, and raised her chest as if to mean serious business.

<br>"QUID ruckinus! there you are sitting in your room, without a single care for the world. did it not occur to you to be a weird thing that nobody had called on you up until now? why do you suppose that is? we have been waiting in the courtyard, both me and your father and the court's majesty. they had guests arrive this morning, and didn’t tell us”… Madam Hore’s voice trailed off as she surveyed her sons chamber, scanning each article of clothing sprawled on the mossy oak floor till her sight found Quid’s messy finger, drooling of blood and saliva onto his awkward lap. Madam Hore instantly lunged at her son, clasping her hands around his fleshy finger, with a strength that was sure to bring our amateur cannibal to agony. But Quid Ruckinus was a bit mentally preoccupied, staring straight on at his mother’s cleavage where her bulging breasts hinted at the tightness of her corset. As he painstakingly stared forward, focused on the bright red skin that formed a line around the cusp of the corset across her chest, more viscous liquid dripped onto his lap, but this time coming exclusively from his gaping mouth.
<br>“Those may be easier to gnaw on…” he thought.
<br>His mother, never knowing how to handle her gawking son, pushed his head into her breast, cooing to his bashful demeanour while his finger lay twitching on his lap, patiently waiting to be treated. While this spectacle was going on in Quid Ruckinus’ chamber room, we take the journey down the winding cobble steps into the courtyard where our remaining characters await. Among the crowd was Qort Tuft, Quid’s beloved friend who just returned from China with a cart of various props they were to use during their jester performances.

<br>And performed did they ever!. When Quid Ruckinus received his proper bandaging and coddling, he followed his mother (hand in hand) down the stairs of the tower and through to the center of the rose garden, where the audience sat in anticipation.

<br>“M’lady Hore!” squealed the large chested female member sitting in the front of the crowd. “We’ve been waiting for your son” mumbled another anxious attendee. Madame Hore proceeded with the formalities of apologizing for Quid’s tardiness to the royals and their guests (an extra apology always has to be given on behalf of her son, but on this particular day the pleading took a while longer). Qort Tuft was standing beside the royal guests with a crazed grin towards his friend. Just by the sheer appearance of these two gentlemen, it’s quite clear why they were appointed as the royal fools of the kingdom. Qort Tufts stature was slightly crooked, particularly at the neck, and one of his eyes was lame (so when he looked at you, you weren’t exactly sure if he could meaningfully bring the vision of both his left and right eye together to form a cohesive image). And the particular smile he chose to wear that day was especially fevered and crazed.

<br>When Madame Hore finished repenting for her son, she stepped aside to allow Quid greet the awaiting party. Forgetting all about the preliminary etiquettes he was to start with, Quid’s reaction to his friend’s grin registered an impulse in him that made him completely forget the crowd, running straight across the clearing to embrace his friend.
<br>“Qort!”
<br>“Quid!”.
<br>The two friends embraced lovingly (which was exceedingly passionate for the members whose murmuring fell silent in awe at the homoerotic spectacle that enfolded in their wake). And so thus again, Madame Hore interfered with her son’s private engagements and pulled him apart, whispering sharp hissing words into both of their ears. Blushing and chuckling, the two jesters relaxed their distance from one another and began their jesterly performance.

<br>For the final act of the show, Qort brought out his Chinese prize and presented it proudly to Quid.
<br>“And behold, an ass!” exclaimed Qort, hands-on-hip.
<br>Quids eyes widened and his whole expression went so loose, we couldn’t really be too surprised if more drool was to fall from our impressionable characters lips.

<br>The Ass stepped forward, as if to introduce himself.

<br>What do you reckon his name should be, Quid?” Qort asked, intent on animating his jester persona for the crowd.
<br>But Quid was not able to do the same. He looked (we want to say blankly) at the donkey and felt an unusually strong feeling of kinship overcome him, one that he never felt before.
<br>“What did you say the donkeys name was?”
<br>“Hotei”.
<br>Quid cocked his head to the side, staring at the curious ass. The donkey made a similar effort to glance into Quids eyes, swaying his head left and right so that each eye on the side of his head could see his opponents’s sweaty face in its entirety.
<br>“Charming isn’t he?” Asked Qort.
<br>“More like Charmed…” replied Quid. “This donkey… he fancies my face, I think”.

<br>The crowd, seemingly invested in this exchange, is overcome with a bellowing laughter. Not because the jesters were giving on a good performance per se, but more resulting out of the abundance of wine that was served earlier on to the crowd to stall them from noticing the belatedness of Quids appearance.

<br>The sun started to set over the cusps of the town roofs, laying down a sheer gray shadow over the members seated in the royal garden, an illuminating glow was mixed into the hue, coming from the candle lit rooms of the castle which wrapped itself around the little garden patch. With this setting sun came an ominous aura, that was first felt by the Donkey, Ho-Tei. He trotted a little in one spot, digging his hooves into the dirt and swaying his low hanging head left and right as to scan the crowd suspiciously. And this suspicious mood borne true: there was someone in the crowd who was not amused by the Quid’s show. In fact, he was never laughing during any of the shows. We know him as the true Foe of Quid Ruckinus, but bless Quids heart because he thinks the chap actually fancies him.

<br>This boy - bordering on a young adult, had an extremely large stature, with many ripples on his arms on account of his well defined and dimensional musculature. He was the Court’s high guard, appointed to keep order of the court and its neighbouring lands. His reasons for not liking Quid were never exclaimed aloud or made known by word of mouth, but we needn’t think hard to think of why he didn’t enjoy foolery.

<br>For one, Quids performances involved making fun of the Royal court and its high officials. However, the king and queen were both either asleep or too drunk during the performances to grasp the premise of Quids jokes. It didn’t help either that many were unintelligible, consisting sometimes simply of pointing at the cook’s mole and screaming “arrest the Mole!!!”.

<br>So, while the crowd laughed drunkenly at his performance each evening, Guard Muze Clés grit his teeth angrily as Quid Ruckinus and his side act Qort Tuft insulted everyone including themselves. It was a degree of offence that Muze couldn’t stand. He was an extremely principled and religious man. Raised on Russian Philosophy and the works of the pre Socratic philosophers, he liked order and respect to be shown in the court. What quid and Qort stood for was the ante thesis of the principles he used to guide his life.

<br>Muze indeed thought it was strange that the donkey chose to glare at him alone. It was common tales that animals, especially larger ones and closer to size of humans would watch what people did and make sure all impious and unethical acts would become known to everyone. Muze was especially bothered by this donkey and its abnormal habit of making direct eye contact with the crowd and seemingly looking at the jesters when they were talking about him. Muze wondered whether this Donkey was one of those animals told in tales, who could do the job of guarding the affairs of the court better than mortal humans. “If”, Muze thought, “if I wanted to truly restore order to this place, would I have to remove the jesters or the donkey?”.

<br>Contented with their performance for the night, the jesters took their final bow, cleared their throats especially loudly so that the drowsy king would awaken and order the rest of the court into the grand hall for dinner dessert and drink.

<br>But how beautiful was the garden place, court, castle and grand hall? Can words any justice to it? Let us try…
<br>At this hour, dusk had settled in well, and the fireflies emerged from their nesting homes to illuminate various parts of the garden. From afar it looked like each rose was a lantern in itself, swaying and flickering with light as the fireflies flew to and fro between each patch of tall roses. In the further distance, the castle enclosed the garden in a perfect square. Its cobblestones were fairly free of vines, which was thanks to the dutiful gardeners and court workers. each window was always lit during the night, and the ever so soft orange glow made the journey into the castle so inviting.

<br>In order of importance, each member made way back into the castle. Qort led Donkey Ho-Tei before Quid, to jest with him, but Quid unsurprisingly didn’t get the joke, perhaps fully expecting that it’d be reasonable a donkey would go before him in the court. Following distantly behind the crowd, guard Muze clés scanned the horizon behind the castle once more, checking that the silhouettes of the hills miles beyond the castles perimeters didn’t have flickering lights of their own, for this would imply that there was a settlement nearby.
