        Balls<br><br><br>






<br>in the modern world, brute strength is substituted by the courage to defy unproductive social rules. a person who knows how to refuse a scam, remove themselves from a potentially dangerous situations without getting themselves in trouble with the law has become a new mode of strategizing against the strategizer (ie the institutions that have set up the rules of compliance) without going too far. balls are what is needed to survive. long gone are the days of pitch forks in the physically tussling world. Now, brains and social intellect are what secure the passing on of your genes. It's important to note that iconoclastic personalities are the type that can 'break' free from rat-race dogmas, or mass-accepted realities that are simply untrue. So, when we negatively condition society against controversy, it is just operating to maintain submission, complacency, and servile bodies. Politics is the vehicle by which this is achieved. If you step out of line and philosophize past the node and into the taboo, you will risk ostracization.
<br><br>however, an important phenomenon is that if you manage to do the queer, the abnormal, the unorthodox path, and are accepted artistically or scientifically for your wit, the masses will praise you. it is strange. but it only happens after objective success. but the path there is one of rejection, of pain, of feeling as though you have done all wrong. but those who can bite the bullet for their art and risk the worst casualty that ones ego can take, is worth the forbidden fruit. 
<br><br>irrespective of the content of one's art, i respect the pursuit, because it is not an easy journey.  i wish people would learn to commend a life lived for its own sake, without descending to moralizing means and thinking that any one human can judge the content of another life without having personally walked that path themselves. we should respect eachother for no other reason other than that life comes with a host of pains (loss, heartbreak, nostalgia, humiliation), and anyone who differs from you in individual choices (job, politics, mental stability) is not higher than you on a moral scale.
