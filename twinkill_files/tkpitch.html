        <p><b><i>"Twin, Kill"</i></b> is a sci-fi, feature-length script 
written by Rassvyet. It's a story of bonding love, techno-criminal cruelty, an underground world with fantastical characters, and a girl that thinks that she can run away from pain. But her twin proves her dead wrong.  </p>
        <p style="color: #f8d0a2; text-align: left; font-size: 20px;">After her mother's suicide, Lia remained in Toronto only in body. Feeling emotionally untethered from friends, family, and any recognizable sense of home, 
                the city felt like a dystopia. 
                And it was exactly that: an eternally rainy purgatory, lined with pulsing street lights and neon signs. 
                People brushed past her with absent minds, beating the sidewalk with urgent steps going nowhere. </p>
        <p style="color: #f8d0a2; text-align: left; font-size: 20px;"> Lectures were spent dreaming of running away, vanishing into the anonymity of a different life. One day, as she was musing in class, she notices a pair of eyes watching her attentively. 
                This new student was unnoticeable, but he had a look in his eyes of familiar brokenness. As she befriends this boy named Alex, she halts her plans of running away. But his fragility was mistaken for understanding. 
                One night at a party, he assaults her. The betrayal devoured her last standing hope in a life already defined by loss. 
                Her mind splinters, her defenses calcify, and in a drunken, manic haze, she stumbles through the city toward an underground crime café, a place where illicit fantasies are transacted in digital silence. 
                At one of the dimly lit booths, she discovers a hitman service that offers not just murder—but substitution. 
                The interface promises a clean escape: your perfect doppelgänger commits the crime, and remains behind to take the fall. You vanish, No loose ends guaranteed. It sounds like salvation. Lia places the order.<br>
                
                <br>In the following week, her days and nights blurred into one, and her mind descended into despair, until she receives the text indicating her order is ready. Following the coordinates, she's led to a dilapidated motel on the edge of the city, all blood-red light and humming vacancy. Inside, a gangster with curious, gentle eyes asks her to recount her story. Perhaps out of mercy, or curiosity, or some deeper logic, he listens. And when she finishes, he disappears into the bathroom, returning with a bundle wrapped in a translucent, soaking sheet.

<br><br>The body inside is Noa—her double. Unconscious, wet and shivering, Noa's pale skin is free from history - no tattoos, no piercings, no slash marks. She is Lia without the ruin. Lia before the silence. Before her grief turned her into a husk. And something in Lia fractures again; not violently, but slowly, like frost melting.

<br><br>As Noa awakens, it becomes clear that her mind is blank, wiped clean of memory of her past life. She doesn’t remember, or know how to open a car door. She struggles with putting on clothing. But amidst that unawareness, she still smiles at butterflies. She moves with the disarming gentleness of someone who has never been touched by malice. Lia trains her in the art of survival, and then in the art of killing. Coldness. Silence. Focus.  

<br><br>But something begins to grow between them. At first, it’s merely uncanny: they stir their tea in the same clockwise spiral, flinch at loud noises with the same instinct. Then, it becomes intimate. Lia finds herself watching Noa sleep. She begins dressing her. She stops giving orders, and begins asking questions.  

<br><br>What started as a utilitarian relationship shifts into something unnameable—maternal, sisterly, romantic, perhaps all three. Noa becomes more than a clone. She becomes a companion. A mirror. A reminder of what Lia once was, and might still become.

<br><br>The night of the planned assassination arrives. Noa is sent to do the job. She wears Lia’s black coat, Lia’s gloves. She walks with practiced confidence into the alley where Alex, unsuspecting—or perhaps suspicious—waits. But something goes wrong. A flicker of hesitation. A misstep. Lia, who has secretly followed her, sees it all. Worse: Alex is armed. With a double of his own.

<br><br>The confrontation erupts quickly. There is no time for speeches, no dramatic pause. Just motion and blood. Lia throws herself between them and ends it. Alex collapses, steam rising from the wound in his chest as the rain falls. The deed is done. The plan, technically, complete.

<br><br>But in this moment of resolution, Lia faces the choice that had always been buried beneath the logistics: Does she vanish alone, leaving Noa behind as planned? Or has the clone—this ghost of her younger self—become more than an accessory to her pain?

<br><br>Noa is trembling. Lia was supposed to walk away. But something in her—something long buried—refuses to go.  

<br><br>She reaches for Noa’s hand.

<br><br>They flee together. </p>

        <h2>Initial Pitch</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../assets/blackbunch.png" alt="A storyboard header featuring stylized text that reads, 'TOME of the UNKNOWN', next to a small square icon in linocut style that depicts Wirt and Greg's silhouettes inside of a forest."></p>
        <p>While it was conceived in early 2024, <i>"Twin, Kill"</i>'s first pitch is being put out in late 2025.
 This page is dedicated as a visual guide for the story, when I eventually begin circulating my script to close family &amp; friends.</p>
        <p><i>Twin Kill</i> is a story about processing lonliness and apathy. It takes curious turns through moral crossroads, with complex characters that can't be neatly placed in either the 'good' or 'evil'. 
        These characters are intentionally <i>beyond</i> their descriptors. Friends can be flawed, and enemies can be sympathized for. But for our main character, she must come to terms with the unfair life she's had,
to make room for the future potential happiness. </p>
        <p>The pain that our main character feels starts to go away when her twin arrives. This twin, being a doppelganger, bears no true genetic similarity to our main character. However, through nurture, the time that the girls spend
                together makes ripples in each of their neurologies; they become connected in uncanny ways, that is only possible through the hormone of love.</p>

        <p><i>Twin Kill </i> is a multi-faceted story, with side sequences that shiver the story, that make it shed its apathetic air, turning the story into something warm, pulsing with life.</p>

        <p>Currently, this story is in its final editing phase. After my dearest friends have read the script, I will make further adjustments before taking the project off-site (you know what i mean).</p>

        <h2>Dramatis Personae</h2>
        <h3>Lia</h3>
        <img src="../assets/lia.jpg" alt="Wirt in a field with his jaw dropped and eyes wide, looking shocked." style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; width: 300px;">
        <p>Lia, a university student, is the main protagonist of <i>Twin Kill</i>. Her staple outfit is a black leather jacket, boots made to stomp with, and black eyeliner. She's either smoking, riding her motorcycle, or eyeing people suspiciously.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center; color: #ddb78b;">"Fuck these people and this evil city. What can be said of a place that makes sins more fun than virtue? Now add weak lonely people into the mix, and that's gotham for you"</p>
        <p>Lia is a tough girl. She was taught early on in her life to rely on no-one. When her mom abandoned her in a train station one day, she vowed to never trust a person's love again. 
        Every friendship and relationship she had afterwards felt like a phantom embrace; she could never fully give in to it. As she approaches the end of her final year, she makes a runaway plan, thinking that she'll just follow her mom's footsteps and leave everything behind.         
        </p>
        <p>When Lia meets Noa, she's initially annoyed by the naivety and stupidity of her constant fawning. She feels a resentment building up within her that she thinks must be what her own mother felt towards her. But as she 
                teaches Noa the assasin plan, Lia realizes the beauty in purity, and her protectiveness awakes within her heart. Now that she can feel again, can she bear to abandon a person who loves and depends on her? Can she repeat the pain of her past onto another soul? Is she as corrupted as she thinks she is?</p>

                <h3>Noa</h3>
        <img src="noa.gif" alt="Noa looking at Lia." style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; width: 350px">
        <p>"Noa" is the property of DPG INC., which is an underground service that provides neurologically engineered humans for purchase and hire. Her legal owner is Lia, but she was altered in a lab years ago. Her life before then is unclear, but 
                glitches in her memory suggest that she was a psychology student who loved butterflies. In <i>Twin Kill</i>, she usually wears softer, brighter colours. When she was cognitively harvested, the technicians at DPG INC., shrunk her capacity for empathy, making her suitable for 
                the needs of most criminals. Thus, she is wired to kill and hunt. But reminisces of a sentimental, tender girl is still present. Why this occured is a question in Twin Kill. According to the instruction manuel, Doubles 
                may malfunction if they are not dethawed correctly. And as we see, Lia left her double unattended during those crucial first 24 hours, which may explain why we see a more 'human' double than the others depicted in <i>Twin Kill.</i></p>
        <p style="text-align: center; color: #826c53;">"Look at those shrunken heads! They're so cute! Can we take them home? Can we, please?"</p>
        <p>Noa is an incredibly sweet and loveable character. She sees beauty in the grotesque, fears the harmless, but protects Lia with a ferocity of a thousand tigers. Her amygdala is superwired, which gives her
                access to strength that only occurs when our adrenaline is at peak. Bodybuilders don't stand a chance against a loyal, neuromaxxed girl.</p>
       
        <h3>X</h3>
        <img src="../assets/x.png" alt="bald, gold hooped gangster leaning back in his chair." style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; width: 300px">
        <p>X is the owner of DPG INC. He frequents all the underground crime cafes, with the aid of his 2 freakishly tall doubles (with whom he speaks an unidentified language with). He's a character neither good or evil. 
                When Lia stumbles into the cafe in a drunken haze, he offers his services to her, with the intention of gifting her something he thinks might help her. However, the nature of the game knows no loyalty. He also provides service to her enemy in <i>Twin Kill</i>, Alex.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center; color: #826c53;">"Don't imply favouritism among my clients. I'm not for that."</p>
        <p>X is, nonetheless a caring character for Lia. Although he'll never admit it, he watches over her during the many underground parties that take place throughout <i>Twin Kill</i>, ensuring to step in when needed.
        He's full of curiousity, and knows when to push back on Lia's pessimism. This provides a form of irony, since his enterprise is an utterly sadistic one. Needless to say, Noa is not a fan of him, but the two 
        provide the audience with comedy in their spiteful exchanges.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center; color: #826c53;">X:    "Oh, how pleasant to see you both. Hi again Noa dear - i hope you've calmed down now and seen I'm a totally nice gentle-."<br><br>
        Noa stares on, with a deadpan glare, stabbing the icecream in her bowl.</p>

        <h3>Alex</h3>
        <img src="alex.gif" alt="The Woodsman bending a knee in order to pick some Edelwood sticks up off the ground, mid-speech." style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; width: 230px;">
        <p>Alex is both the victim and enemy. He befriends Lia during a party, tricks her into giving him a chance on account of being new and friendless. He tries to take advantage of her in a basement of a party,
                not knowing that he took the last straw. He becomes the perfect target for Lia. She takes him out, she'd be leaving toronto in a better state than when she was living there. That's a fair outcome, she thinks.
                But perhaps she underestimates the commonality of evil. In her own words, this city breeds sin. But can she plan a crime faster than a psychopath can?
                Throughout the parties and craze of <i>Twin Kill,</i> Alex is looming around the scene. She has to stomach the bastard that took her dignity. Not for long, though. 
          </p>
        <p style="text-align: center; color: #826c53;">"I have a feeling like I need protection, I need to watch my back..."</p>
        <p>As a promised motif of <i>Twin Kill, </i> no character is simply evil. Alex craves love, but can't get it. He tries to steal it, to force it out of the world, not knowing that his method 
                doomed to only prophesize the opposite. He develops an obsession for Lia, something that she can ambiently feel. However, the danger is doubled, since Alex cannot distinguish between Noa and Lia. Let's pray they 
        never run into eachother before the assasination date.</p>



        <h3>Bjorn &amp Josefine</h3>

        <p>Josefine is one of Lia's closest friends in <i>Twin Kill</i>. She is the host of many ilicit underground night parties that take place in the notorious <i>Cat Cafe</i>, where criminals from all around the gangstrous world are invited. The parties are 
                extravagent, bizarre, one of a kind. She puts these shows on with her friend &amp; business partner, Bjorn. She befriends all, being utterly desensitized to the hallow workings of politics, war and crime.

        <p style="text-align: center; color: #826c53;">"Oh, Josefine... You invited the Maaruk people again? They left one gold bar as a tip in exchange for making sashimi out of our shark. "</p>
        <p>Little is known about the Bjorn other than that is Josefine's closest confidance and business partner. He oversees the operations of Catcafe, while Josefine seemingly maintains the relations of the patrons
                Which is a very hard job, to please gangsters and polititions. They are both aquiantences of X, having used his services to acquire doubles of their own, as entertainment for catcafe. Their albino acrobatic 
        twins, Natty & Atta, are the true epitome of Doppelgangers and the mischeivous ways that these beings can function. </p>

        <p>Atta &amp; Natty are Josefine's &amp; Bjorn's doubles. They are albino twins that are special orders from DPG Inc., being purchased and put into use for the sole purpose of entertainment for <i>CatCafe.</i>
                They have been programmed to be sexually desensitized. As a result, they are also providing brothel services to the underground.

        <h2>Chapters</h2>
        <p>The following is a list of the main acts of <i>Twin Kill</i>, as well as a brief synopsis of each part, assuming the reader cannot read the 150 paged-script</p>
       
        <h3>Chapter 1: The ending and the beginning</h3>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../assets/vines.png" alt="A screencap from episode one, showing Wirt and Greg shocked as the the Woodsman surprises them."></p>
        <p>Lia sits on the shore, smoking her cigarette, as she starts her story.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center; color: #826c53;"><b>Lia (Voiceover): </b> I didn't think I'd make it this far. Am I happy? I think I now know, without a shadow of a doubt, the answer to my question </p>
        
        <h3>Chapter 2: The Alex Party </h3>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../assets/vines.png" alt="A screencap from episode two, showing a pumpkin man standing beneath a dreary, grey sky. He's overlooking a field and holding a pole to which a white flag has been tied."></p>
        <p>Lia, on her way to a party, meets a lost boy in one of the student housing side streets. He introduces himself as Alex, insists that he's been invited to a party but can't navigate there. Lia, feeling 
                pity for him, decides to walk with him there. They reach the house. He timidly follows her inside. She finds her group of friends and begins to drink. Alex, offering to toast to his new found friend,
                suggests they take a shot together. The liquor has been emptied from the fridges and kegs, so he suggest to raid the basement cabinets. Lia agrees. There, he makes a move. She rejects him, but he 
                denies her claims of being a lesbian. He pushes, and she shoves him back. He grabs her, and she runs out of the party, feeling like this is the straw that broke the camel's back.</p>
        
        <h3>Chapter 3: In Drunken Haze, The Double is Ordered!</h3>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../assets/vines.png" alt="A screencap from episode three of Greg and Ms. Langtree smiling at each other as she plays piano."></p>
        <p>Lia, in a fit of anger and drunkedness, decides to go straight to the criminal junction of toronto. She seeks out a well-known underground hitman cafe, where people go to get deeds done without dirtying their own 
                paws. She tries to set up a deal with these classic italian mobsters, but they try to take advantage of her, on account of being a young girl. A man steps in to break off the dispute. His name is X, and he's 
                a notorious hit4hire supplier. He was watching Lia from across the murky room, interested in what a pure-hearted girl would want with a place like this. He hears her story. He says he knows exactly what she needs. 
                He proposes a 'double', or a doppelganger, which would look exactly like her, and be a fully trainable human decoy that could carry out her crime and take her place in prison, so she can successfully run away 
                without leaving behind a life where anyone would come looking for her. She's hurt, but satisfied with this plan. She orders the double. He vanishes without a trace, but tells her that she will receive the 
                dropoff details within the week. Lia goes home and sleeps off the night.</p>


        <h3>Chapter 4: First Pick-up Nerves: The Girls Meet!</h3>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../assets/vines.png" alt="A screencap from episode four showing the patronage of the tavern holding Wirt and Greg up above their heads; everyone is cheering."></p>
        <p>Lia wakes up, not fully sure if everything was a big nightmare or not. She goes about her week, attending classes, hardly focusing, hardly daydreaming. She sees Alex around campus, and avoids him at all costs.
                A few days go by. She recieves a text on her phone with coordinates. Realizing the dent she had put in her bank account with this order, she decides to pick up her product.</p>

                <p>She calls a taxi cab and arrives at the run-down 70's love motel. She goes down the windy hallway and knocks at the door. A freakishly tall gentleman opens, and a second, nearly identical one appears behind.
                        She shows the text. They allow her in. There, she sees X, sitting on the velvet couch chewing on a choco-wafer. He invites her to sit down. Upon talking with her, he asks and critiques her plan (the very one he proposed to her, by the way!)
                        As they exchange pleasantries and off-hand remarks to one another, X abruptly silences her and goes to check for something in the bathroom. The double is ready. The two tall men go inside the phorphorescent foggy room and emerge with 
                        a wet, cold, body wrapped in a diaphonous white sheet. She is placed on the bed. X prompts Lia to walk up to the bed, to examine her product. It's a young girl, nearly identical to Lia in stature and face. Lia asks questions, and X answers,
                        but she is unable to retain any information. 

                                <p style="text-align: center; color: #826c53;"><b>LIA:</b> What's her name?<br>
                                <b>X:</b> Don't be silly, she hasn't got one.<br>
                                <b>LIA:</b>What <i>was</i> her name?<br><br>
                                X goes to check his notebook.<br><br>
                                <b>X:</b> Her name was Noa.<br><br>
                                Lia whispers to herself: <br> 
                                <b>LIA:</b> "noa..."
                                </p>
                        
                        The moment is too overwhelming. X relays important information, including reciting a disclaimer from his corporation from heart. Then, he receieves a phone call and steps away, speaking
                        in an alien tongue to the interlocuter. The two tall men package Noa up, and send Lia on her way. She makes her way to the apartment, placing Noa on the bed. She goes to bed. In the morning,
                        she leaves for school, putting a bowl of water near Noa.
                </p>

        
        <h3>Chapter 5: The Sisters Meet (consciously)</h3>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../assets/vines.png"alt="A screencap from episode five showing Greg, Endicott, and Fred the horse standing in Endicott's greenhouse."></p>
        <p>Wirt, Greg, and Beatrice, in the pursuit of change to ride a 
ferry, must help the wealthy but slightly loony Quincy Endicott solve 
the mystery of a beautiful yet terrifying ghost that has been haunting 
his massive estate.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center; color: #826c53;"><b>Endicott:</b> Yes, tea! That's my trade! 'Quincy Endicott's Health Tea'.<br><b>Greg:</b> Your tea sounds good.<br><b>Endicott:</b> Ugh! Never touch the stuff myself.</p>
        <p><b>Trivia</b>: Because the Unknown is informed by Wirt's 
interests, Endicott, too, is a character from Wirt's real life. In Ep. 
9, you can see a tombstone bearing Endicott's name!</p>
        <h3>Chapter 6: Lullaby in Frogland</h3>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../assets/vines.png"alt="A screencap from episode six of Wirt and Greg playing with the band aboard the ship. Greg is 'disguised' as a drum."></p>
        <p>Now aboard the ferry, Wirt, Greg, and Beatrice have a chance 
to relax. However, once they disembark and secretly trail Beatrice to 
Adelaide's house, Wirt and Greg discover that Beatrice hasn't been 
entirely truthful with them.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center; color: #826c53;"><b>Wirt:</b> What's wrong with George Washington being naked?</p>
        <p><b>Trivia:</b>Writer Amalis Levari was the one who provided 
the idea for the scissors Adelaide holds over Beatrice's head. They're 
inspired by a real pair of scissors Levari's mother showed her, and they
 pay homage to how her mother was the one to teach her textile arts.</p>
        <h3>Chapter 7: The Ringing of the Bell</h3>
        <p style="text-align: center"><img src="../assets/vines.png" alt="A screencap from episode seven showing Wirt and Greg shushing each other and covered in turtles."></p>
        <p>Stung by Beatrice's betrayal, Wirt and Greg seek shelter in 
what they assume to be an abandoned cottage. Things get complicated when
 they meet its residents: Lorna, and her Auntie Whispers.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center; color: #826c53;"><b>Woodsman:</b> 
Stop! Listen! The Beast knows your presence, ready to claim you as part 
of his dark forest, but only if you give up! Keep hearty in both body 
and spirit and you shall be safe from him. Fall ill or lose hope and 
your life shall pass into his crooked hands. Children, please heed my 
warning! Boys, beware the Beast!</p>
        <p><b>Trivia:</b> The mystery of the black turtles was one the 
show writers never intended to solve, but it was clearly hinted that 
they represented some form of evil to the Unknown. Auntie Whispers 
serves as a sort of sin eater to counter Adelaide, but the devouring of 
the turtles has clearly had an effect on her.</p>
        <h3>Chapter 8: Babes in the Wood</h3>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../assets/vines.png" alt="A screencap from episode eight that shows Greg singing along with a host of colourful creatures such as winged animal heads and child angels."></p>
        <p>Exhausted, Wirt has a one-sided argument with Greg before the
 pair fall asleep beneath a tree. While sleeping, Greg has a strange 
dream at the end of which he finds out Wirt cannot leave the Unknown 
since the Beast has laid claim to him.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center; color: #826c53;"><b>Wirt:</b> I don't know much of anything anymore.<br><b>Greg:</b> Oh. Did you know that dinosaurs had big ears but everyone forgot 'cuz dinosaur ears don't have bones?</p>
        <p><b>Trivia</b>: In the background of Greg's dream, you can see a little gnome of an old man, dressed like Wirt and holding a lantern.</p>
        <h3>Chapter 9: Into the Unknown</h3>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../assets/vines.png" alt="A screencap from episode nine showing Wirt after he's put on his signature outfit. He's looking in the mirror with a fan on to make his cape blow, and he's throwing his arms in the air."></p>
        <p>It's Halloween, and Wirt has finished recording a cassette 
for Sara, his crush. Greg decides to help Wirt deliver it to her when 
Wirt backs out, but this has unintended consequences for the pair.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center; color: #826c53;"><b>Greg:</b> Thank you, Old Lady Daniels!<br><b>Mrs. Daniels:</b> Goodbye, Gregory. And please don't call me 'old lady'.<br><b>Greg:</b> Yes, sir, young man!</p>
        <p><b>Trivia</b>: Patrick McHale wanted all of the kids in the 
background to look like they were wearing homemade costumes because he 
likes the authenticity this lends. He dislikes storebought costumes 
because they look artificial and nothing like the character being 
represented.</p>
        <h3>Chapter 10: The Unknown</h3>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../assets/vines.png" alt="A screencap from episode ten of the Beast speaking to the Woodsman, who looks troubled, from behind."></p>
        <p>Wirt and Beatrice hunt down Greg in the middle of a 
snowstorm, and are horrified to find the Beast seems to have taken him. 
The pair must make one last stand against their otherworldly pursuer, 
lest they lose Greg forever.</p>
        <p><b>Beatrice's Mother:</b> Now, eat your dirt!<br>[The whole family laughs genially.]</p>
        <p> <b>Trivia</b>: Patrick McHale wanted this episode to feel 
like an opera because of how prominent the Beast is in it. The 
backgrounds and lighting are all meant to emulate the feeling of a 
stage, and the team toyed with the idea of having the sounds of an 
orchestra warming up playing in the background.</p>

        <p>These sketches makes me feel all of Wirt's loneliness. It's like we're getting a glimpse into something we weren't meant to see.</p>

        <p>Something about the red silhouettes makes a shiver go up my spine.</p>

        <h2><i>Over the Garden Wall</i> and Me!</h2>
        <p>Obviously, I made this page because (surprise, surprise!) <i>Over the Garden Wall</i> means a whole lot to me. I first watched the show when I was in Sec. 8, and it was basically love at first sight.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="MEP8BAY_o.png" alt="A pencil sketch concept art of Wirt and Greg, drawn mostely as crude shapes, trekking through the forest."></p>
        <p>I can't really explain the weird degree of comfort I get from
 getting lost in the quiet pastoral towns, deceptively wonderful winter 
wonderlands, and dense forestation of the Unknown, but know it's a lot! 
Every time I rewatch this show, I notice something new, and it always 
surprises me just how much such a short show was able to pack in.</p>
        <p>My favourite episode is probably 'Songs of the Dark Lantern' 
by a hair. I love the varied personalities we're introduced to, the 
silly songs, and the confrontation with the Woodsman. My favourite 
character is eiter Wirt, the Woodsman, Beatrice, or Greg, but that's 
basically the entire main cast so it's a moot point. My favourite songs 
off the soundtrack are 'Patient is the Night', 'Send Me a Peach', 'A 
Courting Song', 'Tome of the Unknown', and 'Black Train/End Credits'!</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="MEP8BB2_o.png" alt="A pencil sketch concept art of the Beast, showing him as a furred creature with a man's stature but the vague silhouette of a devil. He is wreathed in a raggedy cape and is holding a staff in one thin hand. His eyes are round white circles, and his front teeth are long and thin."></p>
        <p>I love watching it with my friends or with my siblings, or 
just by myself. I love listening to Ms. Langtree bemoaning the loss of 
her beloved Jimmy, and I love the weird rotoscope-y animation of the 
Highwayman's song. I love the Woodsman and his tragedy, and I always 
sniffle a little when Anna, his daughter, returns home in the epilogue. I
 love Enoch and his contemplative voice, and I love the sprawling 
expanse of the joint Endicott-Grey mansion. I always look forwards to 
getting to rewatch it when Fall rolls around.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="MEP8BB5_o.png" alt="A pencil sketch of Greg running up to an Edelwood tree captioned, 'Greg: We found the ugliest tree in the world!'."></p>
        <p>All that to say, I hope you liked reading through this page 
almost as much as I liked spending hours making it, and I hope it's 
inspired you to watch the show if you haven't, and made you think about 
it if you have!<br></p>
        <p style="text-align: center; color: #826c53;">That's goodbye for now...<br><br>With much love,<br>Tehsin!</p>
