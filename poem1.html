<p>
With my love, <br>
I could have filled ten centuries with fire, songs and valour; ten whole centuries, long and winding epochs of poetry and prose, penned to your name...<br>
Many hymns for your amber eyes and their mosaic array; that glisten while you ruminate in somber tones, streaming tears that befall my lap -
crying arrow's shot from Olympus' peak.<br>
and that beauty... sonnets will dance to it forever; to your ivory skin, auburn hair with woodsy streaks of brown, a look so moving yet statuesque, you are left to wonder: who undid medusa's curse?
Tell me, how many more years can i devote to those parting lips of yours? that speak to conceal the truth,<br>
unmooring my trust in you.<br>
Lastly, my beloved.../ confess: eternity would not even suffice to elucidate that beauty in your pain,<br>
that kindness that grew out of the shadows,<br>
that taught you the value of tenderness,<br>
suce you were not handled so gently in your youth.</p>
